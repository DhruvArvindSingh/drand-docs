## Key Points

- Be respectful.
- Need help? Contact: [abuse@ipfs.io](mailto:abuse@ipfs.io).
- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Violations may result in immediate and permanent expulsion.
- Ignorance of this document is not an excuse.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community members at all times, in all community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications related to the project. It covers the use of our public infrastructure, including the drand network, events, and services.

## Creating a Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, or any other personal characteristic.

Respect differing opinions and understand that disagreement is not an excuse for rudeness. Disruptive behaviors like spamming, trolling, or flaming are not tolerated.

Harassment includes:

- Threatening or demeaning behavior
- Harmful comments related to personal characteristics
- Inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, or explicit language in public spaces
- Threats of harm
- Intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording

- Unwelcome sexual attention

## Reporting Violations

If you believe someone is harassing you or violating this Code of Conduct, [contact us](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md#contact-info) with an abuse report. Provide as much detail as possible to help us address the issue effectively.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop such behavior must comply immediately. The team may take any action deemed appropriate, including temporary bans or permanent expulsion without warning.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, notify the team. We will handle your grievance appropriately to foster a safe and friendly community.

## Contact Information

As our community remains small, the [IPFS abuse team](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md#contact-info) acts as a neutral arbiter for Code of Conduct and abuse issues within drand.

Contact us if you are unsure about content appropriateness. We are happy to provide guidance.
