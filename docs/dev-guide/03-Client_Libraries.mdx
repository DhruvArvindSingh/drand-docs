# drand Client Libraries

Client libraries enable easy access to drand randomness in specific programming languages. They also provide peace of mind by *verifying* randomness rounds and add additional features like failover, racing, aggregation, and caching.

drand randomness is available over [**HTTP**](./06-HTTP-API.md), [**libp2p PubSub**](./04-PubSub_Network_Integration.md) and gRPC.

Currently, the following client libraries are available:

- [**Go**](https://github.com/drand/drand)
- [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/drand/drand-client)

If your application cannot use the libraries above, you can make requests to the [**HTTP API**](./06-HTTP-API.md) endpoints using `curl`. If you have created a client library or know of a client library not listed here, [**please let us know by opening an issue**](https://github.com/drand/website/issues/new).

### **Install**

```jsx
go get github.com/drand/drand
```

### **Usage**

The Go drand client library is structured with a base client interface in `/client`, and with protocol-specific transport implementations in `/client/http`, `/client/grpc` and `/lp2p/client`. The main `client` package holds transport agnostic logic for retrying, validation, and caching.

For documentation and examples please check the Go clients reference:

- Transport agnostic top-level client: [**https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/drand/drand/client**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/drand/drand/client)

Client implementations (to be used with the above):

- [**HTTP**](./06-HTTP-API.md) client: [**https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/drand/drand/client/http**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/drand/drand/client/http)
- [**libp2p gossip**](./04-PubSub_Network_Integration.md) client: [**https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/drand/drand/lp2p/client**](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/drand/drand/lp2p/client)
- gRPC client: [**https://github.com/drand/go-clients**](https://github.com/drand/go-clients) are typically not externally accessible.

### **Install**

In the browser or [Deno](https://deno.land/) you can grab and use the client from a CDN e.g. [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/drand-client/drand.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/drand-client/drand.js).

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), install with:

```jsx
npm install drand-client
```

### **Usage**

The JS drand client is an esmodule. It has no dependencies and is not transpiled. It can be `import`ed directly in the browser, Deno or Node.js. In Node.js it can be imported from CommonJS using `await import('...')`.
