# 2.0 CONCEPTS (Getting Started)

This section introduces the key concepts behind drand. For information about consuming randomness from a drand network, see the [**Developer's Guide](../dev-guide/3-0-dev-guide). F**or help running a drand network, see the entries under the “For Operators” section. To run node(s) or relay(s) for the [League of Entropy](https://leagueofentropy.org), please [apply to the League](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGwiSz2_gq6NHo3MGyJyH4_GKv_TcY1YmbwkctKlCh5aVToA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to be considered for membership.

- Read the [**What is "drand"?**](../about/1-0-about) section to learn more about drand’s main goals.  It gives an overview of the challenges drand aims to address.
- [**Cryptography**](./) provides an overview of the cryptographic building blocks that drand uses to generate publicly-verifiable, unbiased, and unpredictable randomness in a distributed manner.
- [**Security Model**](2%202%20Concepts%20Security%20Model%20e28de9e2a7a94dcab08d06160879b6c5.md) describes the security considerations taken into account when designing and building drand.
- [**Specification**](2%203%20Concepts%20Specification%203c6b9de90dfd4ccbbdce860edc19b238.md) is a formal description of the drand protocols.
- [**Timelock Encryption**](2%204%20Concepts%20Timelock%20Encryption%207135365c3b0d41ac847faecc9678e124.md) gives all the information on our Timelock Encryption scheme, and links on where to find the tools to use it.
