On Wednesday, December 16, 2020, The League of Entropy, running an [upgraded version of drand](https://github.com/drand/drand/releases/tag/v1.2.5), proudly welcomed The [Quantum Resistant Ledger][QUANTUM] (QRL) to its list of esteemed members. QRL is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform that is secure from the quantum computing advances of tomorrow, as verified by external audits. The [QRL Foundation](https://qrl.foundation/), a not-for-profit organization, supports the research and development of open-source post-quantum blockchain solutions.
