On Wednesday, December 16, 2020, The League of Entropy, running an [upgraded version of drand](https://github.com/drand/drand/releases/tag/v1.2.5), proudly welcomed The [Quantum Resistant Ledger](../The%20League%20of%20Entropy%201e76674b75e249699445799c5083fe78/League%20Partners%2089fecb56737044e5bdfbbb3f6864a422/Quantum%20Resistant%20Ledger%20b3e60c968098435790c3718f85ed3057.md) (QRL) to its list of esteemed members. QRL is an enterprise-grade blockchain platform that is secure from the quantum computing advances of tomorrow, as verified by external audits. The [QRL Foundation](https://qrl.foundation/), a not-for-profit organization, supports the research and development of open-source post-quantum blockchain solutions.

The League of Entropy evaluates, votes on, and onboards new members quarterly. If you have experience running secure production services and are interested in operating a drand node, weâ€™d love to hear from you.
