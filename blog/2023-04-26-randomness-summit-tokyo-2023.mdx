On the 30th of March, the drand team hosted the second edition of the Randomness Summit alongside [**Real World Crypto**](https://rwc.iacr.org/) in Tokyo, the first having been [**online only in 2020**](https://randomness2020.com/) during the COVID pandemic.

### Overview

The Randomness Summit was a one day conference consisting of talks from a range of speakers on topics such as verifiable randomness functions, verifiable delay functions, distributed key generation, cryptographic specifications, and more!

### Kickoff Presentation

- **Speaker:** Patrick McClurg from [Randamu](../The%20League%20of%20Entropy%201e76674b75e249699445799c5083fe78/League%20Partners%2089fecb56737044e5bdfbbb3f6864a422/Randamu%20e79c7048112749dd9a424a35e959c41a.md)
- **Topic:** Brief overview of drand's progress since the 2020 Randomness Summit.
